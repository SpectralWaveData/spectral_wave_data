# spectral_wave_data

This is the main repository of the Github organization 
[SpectralWaveData](https://github.com/SpectralWaveData).

## Purpose and goals

The main idea is to provide an open API for boosting research and 
industrial application of ocean wave kinematic.
This API can be utilized by academic and commercial software developers 
to assess effects of ocean gravity waves. Not exclusively limited to spectral kinematics, 
but also, as advanced boundary conditions for more sophisticated wave 
models and to study related effects on marine structures.

By using this simple but powerful interface another goal with this API 
is to tear down walls between the fields of oceanography, marine 
hydrodynamics (flow around marine structures) and structural engineering.

## What kind of waves?

There are many spectral formulations out there. Our goal is not to 
implement all of them, but to make the API generic in the sense that 
most formulations can apply this API, and that
additional formulations can easily be tested or added at a later stage
without breaking the current API. At this stage we have implemented 
long and short crested waves propagating in infinite or constant water 
depth. For long crested seas support for varying depth is also included.

The current version has been used for describing, Airy, Stokes, 
Stream waves and Higher-Order-Spectral-Method waves of arbitrary order.
Detailed kinematics of simulated rogue waves can be evaluated.

## Can I apply this API in my programs with only a small effort?

Sure, this is one of our main design goals. Users apply this API with 
minor effort. Ready to use implementations of the API are provided in 
several relevant programming languages. As source code and as precompiled
libraries for Windows and Linux.

- ISO Fortran-2008
- ISO C / C++
- Python 2 and 3

The source code is in this repository.

Precompiled binaries and Python install (wheel) files can be downloaded from 
the "Release" tab of this repository. 

Using Windows-10 you may also install the Python distribution directly from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spectral-wave-data/) using your command line::

    pip install spectral_wave_data

Please check your system dependent [prerequisites](./PREREQUISITES.md)
for all binaries.

Given the MIT license you have freedom to adapt the code to your needs. 
E.g. highly optimizing for your software given the same API. 
You may even implement it in another programing language.

## Does this really work?

Prior to going open software, [DNVGL](https://www.dnvgl.com/) developed
this concept and has applied it since 2015 in programs and projects, 
also extensively in commercial projects. 
A program based on the higher-order-spectral-method (HOSM) was developed 
and this API was applied for providing the nonlinear wave kinematics in 
several application programs:

 - CFD programs like OpenFOAM, StarCCM+, Comflow and Basilisk using client
   specific extensions of these programs.
 - Wasim which is a time domain 3D Rankine boundary-element-method (BEM).
 - WeeBEM is a fully nonlinear 2D-wave tank based on BEM for simulation 
   of steep waves and wave-body interaction (e.g. slamming)

Based on positive experience from these projects and some interesting
lessons learned this open source library has been created.

## Related programs and tools

Programs and tools related to utilizing this API is described in the
tools section of the 
[documentation](https://spectral-wave-data.readthedocs.io/).

## Reference Wave fields

For reference and research, a set of wave fields as described by this API will soon be provided 
in the Github repository __spectral_wave_data_waves__.

Please consider a contribution to that repository if you have an 
interesting SWD wave field to share with our community for research purpose.

Please, contact the maintainers below if you want to upload a wave-train
to the site.

## Documentation

Detailed [documentation](https://spectral-wave-data.readthedocs.io/)
describing theory and implementation is hosted 
on the [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) web site. The associated 
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documents are located in the docs
directory of __spectral_wave_data__.

## Would you like to contribute?

[Contributions, suggestions and discussions](./CONTRIBUTION.md) are 
welcome from organizations and individuals.

For general guide lines on collaboration, read our
[code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to interpret version numbers

We use the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) scheme for versioning. 
For specific interpretation 
in __spectral_wave_data__ see [VERSION.txt](./VERSION.txt).

You never know what will happen when a project is released as open source.
However, due to many years of internal development, redesign and
comprehensive verification we initially don't expect frequent releases.
Consequently, we reccomend to subscribe to the Github "Release Only"
low volume notification service at the top of this page.

The first public release is version 1.0.0. Care has been taken
to reduce the risk of introducing incompatible versions in the 
future. Expanding functionalities and introducing additional
spectral formulations and alternative implementations are accounted
for by design in version 1.0.0. Hence, version 2.0.0 should never come. :-J

The current version, denoted 1.0.0-rc1, is the release candidate
expected to be identical with 1.0.0. Unless users report issues
on specific hardware/OS combinations, an identical version 
will be released using the version tag 1.0.0 on 2020.04.30.

## SpectralWaveData, spectral_wave_data, spectral-wave-data, ...

All programming languages have their own guideline for naming conventions.
Some conventions are not legal syntax in other languages.
Some languages are case sensitive some are not. They have different
concepts and names for modules, packages, classes etc. The documentation
provides specific definitions.

On GitHub we let SpectralWaveData denote the name of the organization containing [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repositories. 
This particular repository is named spectral_wave_data.
