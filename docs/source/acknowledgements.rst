 - Professor `Alexey Slunyaev <https://www.hse.ru/data/2019/02/18/367882482791890/CV%202019feb18.pdf>`_
   suggested a similar approach for coupling
   `WASIM <https://www.dnvgl.com/services/linear-and-non-linear-hydrodynamic-analysis-of-vessels-including-forward-speed-wasim-2413>`_
   with his
   implementation of the Higher-Order-Spectral-Method back in the EU research project Extreme Seas.
   The proof of concept was demonstrated by simulating (in Norway) the ship response induced by a
   Peregrine breather wave simulated by HOSM in Russia. No time spent on merging programs.
   Weird but striking...
 - `DNVGL <http://www.dnvgl.com>`_ supported the initial development and public release of this API.
   DNVGL will continue this effort in collaboration with the industry and academia in an open-source
   environment. The goal is to improve development and communication in this important field of technology.
