If you have issues, or for some other reasons want to contact us please do so.

Bug reports should in general be submitted directly to the GitHub repository.

As for most open source projects, resources are limited. Consequently, we
cannot promise to implement requested features. Especially
within short deadlines.

However, if you have some pressing needs we will consider to do regular consulting work.
The results will be available in the official API with corresponding
acknowledgement to your contribution.

We appreciate your feedback.
