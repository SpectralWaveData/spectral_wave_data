All waves presented on this page are available as SWD-files from the GitHub repository
`spectral_wave_data_waves <https://github.com/SpectralWaveData/spectral_wave_data_waves>`_.
You can download them and evaluate all kinematics as defined in the :doc:`theory <theory>` section
at any relevant location in space and time.


**Examples will soon be uploaded**
