This document provides a recipe for creating a manylinux distribution:

Compile the fortran swd code for python:
========================================
1) Log into a linux machine hosting an Intel fortran compiler. version > 2020.3
2) Copy or clone the complete spectral_wave_data repository to a temp directory on that Linux machine.
   (at least the src, icons and version_definition.py from the root directory)
2) Ensure ifort, cmake>3.20 and python 3.x are in path
3) cd Cmake     (from spectral_wave_data/src/api/python/)
4) bash CMakeBuild_Intel4manylinux.bash
Ensure that no error messages were generated. 
(The libSpectralWaveData.so file should now be located in the Cmake/Build_4manylinux directory)
5) cd ../distribution    (from spectral_wave_data/src/api/python/Cmake)
6) python zip4manylinux.py
7) Note the "Dockerfile" and files4manylinux directory generated by the python script.

On a computer with docker
=========================
8) copy the "Dockerfile" to a temporary directory on a computer with docker installed.
9) Copy the files4manylinux directory (or unpack the files4manylinux.tar.gz) into the temporary folder.
10) Make sure the docker daemon is running
